# Requirements Document - Comprehensive Testing & Validation

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for comprehensive testing and validation of the TacticalOps platform deployment, including domain configuration fixes, SSL setup, and complete feature testing across all system components.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Domain & SSL Configuration

3. IF Cloudflare proxy is enabled THEN the system SHALL use appropriate origin certificates
4. WHEN SSL handshake occurs THEN the system SHALL complete successfully without errors
5. WHEN security headers are requested THEN the system SHALL include HSTS, X-Frame-Options, and CSP headers

### Requirement 2: Authentication System Testing

**User Story:** As a user, I want to securely log into the TacticalOps platform with proper authentication, so that I can access authorized features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN valid credentials are provided THEN the system SHALL authenticate successfully
2. WHEN invalid credentials are provided THEN the system SHALL reject with appropriate error message
3. WHEN user is authenticated THEN the system SHALL provide JWT token with proper expiration
4. WHEN user logs out THEN the system SHALL invalidate the session
5. WHEN accessing protected routes without authentication THEN the system SHALL redirect to login

### Requirement 3: Dashboard Functionality Testing

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want to view comprehensive dashboard with real-time data, so that I can monitor system status and device information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN dashboard loads THEN the system SHALL display device count, status indicators, and recent activity
2. WHEN real-time updates occur THEN the system SHALL refresh data without page reload
3. WHEN dashboard components render THEN the system SHALL show proper GitHub-inspired dark theme
4. WHEN responsive design is tested THEN the system SHALL adapt to mobile, tablet, and desktop screens
5. WHEN performance is measured THEN the system SHALL load dashboard within 2 seconds

### Requirement 4: Device Management Testing

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want to manage and monitor connected devices, so that I can track device status and location.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN devices are listed THEN the system SHALL show device ID, name, model, status, and last seen
2. WHEN device details are requested THEN the system SHALL display comprehensive device information
3. WHEN device location is available THEN the system SHALL show GPS coordinates and map integration
4. WHEN device status changes THEN the system SHALL update indicators in real-time
5. WHEN device data is filtered THEN the system SHALL provide search and sorting capabilities

### Requirement 5: API Endpoints Testing

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all API endpoints to function correctly with proper responses, so that the system integrates properly with external services.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN /api/health is called THEN the system SHALL return 200 with system status information
2. WHEN /api/auth/login is called with valid data THEN the system SHALL return authentication token
3. WHEN /api/dashboard is called THEN the system SHALL return dashboard data in JSON format
4. WHEN /api/device/sync is called THEN the system SHALL handle device synchronization
5. WHEN API errors occur THEN the system SHALL return appropriate HTTP status codes and error messages

### Requirement 6: Database Integration Testing

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the database to function correctly with all operations, so that data is stored and retrieved reliably.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN database connection is tested THEN the system SHALL connect successfully to SQLite database
2. WHEN user data is created THEN the system SHALL store with proper password hashing
3. WHEN device data is inserted THEN the system SHALL maintain referential integrity
4. WHEN GPS logs are recorded THEN the system SHALL store with accurate timestamps
5. WHEN database queries are executed THEN the system SHALL return results within acceptable time limits

### Requirement 7: Security Testing

**User Story:** As a security administrator, I want the system to implement proper security measures, so that the platform is protected against common vulnerabilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN security headers are checked THEN the system SHALL include X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options, HSTS
2. WHEN password storage is tested THEN the system SHALL use bcrypt hashing with appropriate rounds
3. WHEN JWT tokens are issued THEN the system SHALL include proper expiration and signing
4. WHEN input validation is tested THEN the system SHALL sanitize all user inputs
5. WHEN HTTPS is enforced THEN the system SHALL reject insecure HTTP connections

### Requirement 8: Performance Testing

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to respond quickly and efficiently, so that I can work without delays.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN page load time is measured THEN the system SHALL load within 2 seconds
2. WHEN API response time is measured THEN the system SHALL respond within 100ms for health checks
3. WHEN concurrent users access the system THEN the system SHALL maintain performance under load
4. WHEN memory usage is monitored THEN the system SHALL operate within allocated container limits
5. WHEN database queries are executed THEN the system SHALL complete within 50ms for simple queries

### Requirement 9: UI/UX Testing

**User Story:** As a user, I want an intuitive and responsive interface, so that I can easily navigate and use the platform.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN UI components load THEN the system SHALL display GitHub-inspired dark theme consistently
2. WHEN responsive design is tested THEN the system SHALL work on mobile, tablet, and desktop
3. WHEN navigation is used THEN the system SHALL provide clear menu structure and breadcrumbs
4. WHEN forms are submitted THEN the system SHALL provide immediate feedback and validation
5. WHEN accessibility is tested THEN the system SHALL support keyboard navigation and screen readers

### Requirement 10: Integration Testing

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want all system components to work together seamlessly, so that the platform operates as a cohesive unit.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN containers are deployed THEN the system SHALL start all services in correct order
2. WHEN services communicate THEN the system SHALL maintain proper network connectivity
3. WHEN data flows between components THEN the system SHALL maintain data consistency
4. WHEN external integrations are tested THEN the system SHALL handle API calls properly
5. WHEN system restart occurs THEN the system SHALL recover all services automatically

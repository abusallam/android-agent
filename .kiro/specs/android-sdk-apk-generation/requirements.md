# Android SDK Setup and APK Generation Requirements

## Introduction

This specification outlines the requirements for setting up the Android SDK development environment and generating APK files for the Android Agent AI React Native application. The goal is to enable local APK generation and testing on Android devices.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Android SDK Installation

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to install and configure the Android SDK so that I can build and test React Native applications locally.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the developer runs the setup script THEN the Android SDK should be downloaded and installed to the correct location
2. WHEN the Android SDK is installed THEN the ANDROID_HOME environment variable should be set correctly
3. WHEN the SDK is configured THEN the PATH should include Android SDK tools (adb, emulator, etc.)
4. WHEN the installation is complete THEN the developer should be able to run `adb devices` successfully
5. IF the system is Linux THEN the SDK should be installed to `~/Android/Sdk`
6. WHEN the SDK is installed THEN it should include the latest Android platform tools and build tools

### Requirement 2: Android Emulator Setup

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to create and configure Android emulators so that I can test the application without physical devices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the emulator setup runs THEN at least one Android Virtual Device (AVD) should be created
2. WHEN an AVD is created THEN it should use a recent Android API level (API 30+)
3. WHEN the emulator is started THEN it should boot successfully and be detectable by `adb devices`
4. WHEN the emulator is running THEN React Native apps should be able to deploy to it
5. IF hardware acceleration is available THEN the emulator should use it for better performance

### Requirement 3: React Native Build Environment

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to configure the React Native build environment so that I can generate APK files locally.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the build environment is set up THEN Gradle should be properly configured
2. WHEN building the app THEN all required Android dependencies should be available
3. WHEN the build process runs THEN it should complete without SDK-related errors
4. WHEN the APK is generated THEN it should be a valid installable Android package
5. IF the build fails THEN clear error messages should indicate missing dependencies

### Requirement 4: APK Generation Process

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to generate APK files from the React Native application so that I can distribute and test the app on Android devices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the APK generation command is run THEN a debug APK should be created successfully
2. WHEN the APK is built THEN it should include all required permissions and features
3. WHEN the APK is installed on a device THEN the app should launch without crashes
4. WHEN the app runs THEN all native features (camera, location, sensors) should work
5. IF building for production THEN a release APK should be generated with proper signing
6. WHEN the APK is complete THEN it should be saved to a predictable output location

### Requirement 5: Development Workflow Integration

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the Android SDK setup to integrate with the existing development workflow so that APK generation is seamless.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the setup is complete THEN the existing React Native app should build without modifications
2. WHEN using Expo THEN the development server should detect Android devices/emulators
3. WHEN hot reloading THEN changes should reflect immediately on connected Android devices
4. WHEN debugging THEN React Native debugger should work with Android devices
5. IF using physical devices THEN USB debugging should be properly configured

### Requirement 6: Automated Setup Script

**User Story:** As a developer, I want an automated setup script so that I can quickly configure the Android development environment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the setup script runs THEN it should detect the current operating system
2. WHEN dependencies are missing THEN the script should install them automatically
3. WHEN the script completes THEN all environment variables should be properly set
4. WHEN verification runs THEN the script should confirm successful installation
5. IF errors occur THEN the script should provide clear troubleshooting guidance
6. WHEN the setup is done THEN the developer should be able to immediately build APKs

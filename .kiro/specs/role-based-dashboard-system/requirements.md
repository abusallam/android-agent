# Role-Based Dashboard System - Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements a comprehensive Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) system with three distinct user types, each with specific capabilities and dashboard views. The system provides hierarchical access control where ROOT_ADMIN manages project admins, PROJECT_ADMIN manages users, and USERS have access to essential features without administrative capabilities.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: ROOT_ADMIN Dashboard

**User Story:** As a ROOT_ADMIN, I want a dedicated dashboard to manage project administrators and view system-wide metrics, so that I can oversee the entire platform and manage organizational structure.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a ROOT_ADMIN logs in THEN the system SHALL display a ROOT_ADMIN specific dashboard
2. WHEN ROOT_ADMIN accesses the dashboard THEN the system SHALL show metrics for total project admins, total users, and system resources
3. WHEN ROOT_ADMIN wants to add a project admin THEN the system SHALL provide a user creation form with PROJECT_ADMIN role assignment
4. WHEN ROOT_ADMIN views project admins THEN the system SHALL display a list of all PROJECT_ADMIN users with their user counts
5. WHEN ROOT_ADMIN wants to delete a project admin THEN the system SHALL provide deletion capability with confirmation
6. WHEN ROOT_ADMIN accesses user management THEN the system SHALL NOT have access to individual user cameras or devices
7. WHEN ROOT_ADMIN views metrics THEN the system SHALL display system-wide statistics including resource usage

### Requirement 2: PROJECT_ADMIN Dashboard

**User Story:** As a PROJECT_ADMIN, I want a dashboard to manage my assigned users and access their devices, so that I can monitor and control the users under my supervision.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a PROJECT_ADMIN logs in THEN the system SHALL display a PROJECT_ADMIN specific dashboard
2. WHEN PROJECT_ADMIN accesses the dashboard THEN the system SHALL show metrics for users under their management
3. WHEN PROJECT_ADMIN views users THEN the system SHALL display only users assigned to their project
4. WHEN PROJECT_ADMIN wants to access user cameras THEN the system SHALL provide camera access for their assigned users
5. WHEN PROJECT_ADMIN wants to monitor devices THEN the system SHALL show real-time device status for their users
6. WHEN PROJECT_ADMIN accesses streaming features THEN the system SHALL allow video/audio calls with their users
7. WHEN PROJECT_ADMIN views emergency alerts THEN the system SHALL show emergency notifications from their users
8. WHEN PROJECT_ADMIN tries to access other project users THEN the system SHALL deny access
9. WHEN PROJECT_ADMIN wants to add users THEN the system SHALL provide user creation with assignment to their project

### Requirement 3: USER Dashboard

**User Story:** As a USER, I want a dashboard with essential features like emergency assistance and mapping, so that I can access necessary tools without administrative capabilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a USER logs in THEN the system SHALL display a USER specific dashboard
2. WHEN USER accesses the dashboard THEN the system SHALL show emergency button, mapping, and personal device status
3. WHEN USER activates emergency THEN the system SHALL trigger emergency protocols and notify their PROJECT_ADMIN
4. WHEN USER accesses mapping THEN the system SHALL show their location and relevant map features
5. WHEN USER views device status THEN the system SHALL show only their own device information
6. WHEN USER tries to access admin features THEN the system SHALL deny access
7. WHEN USER tries to access other users' data THEN the system SHALL deny access
8. WHEN USER receives calls from PROJECT_ADMIN THEN the system SHALL allow incoming video/audio connections

### Requirement 4: Authentication & Authorization

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want secure role-based authentication, so that users can only access features appropriate to their role.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any user logs in THEN the system SHALL verify credentials and determine user role
2. WHEN user role is determined THEN the system SHALL redirect to appropriate dashboard
3. WHEN user tries to access unauthorized routes THEN the system SHALL redirect to their appropriate dashboard
4. WHEN user session expires THEN the system SHALL require re-authentication
5. WHEN user role changes THEN the system SHALL update their access permissions immediately

### Requirement 5: Data Management & Dummy Data

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive dummy data for testing, so that I can verify all role-based features work correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN system initializes THEN the system SHALL create dummy ROOT_ADMIN account
2. WHEN system initializes THEN the system SHALL create dummy PROJECT_ADMIN accounts with assigned users
3. WHEN system initializes THEN the system SHALL create dummy USER accounts assigned to project admins
4. WHEN dummy data is created THEN the system SHALL include realistic metrics and device data
5. WHEN testing authentication THEN the system SHALL provide clear credentials for each role type

### Requirement 6: Dashboard Navigation & UI

**User Story:** As any user type, I want intuitive navigation that shows only relevant features, so that I can efficiently access my authorized capabilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN user accesses navigation THEN the system SHALL show only menu items relevant to their role
2. WHEN ROOT_ADMIN navigates THEN the system SHALL show admin management and system metrics
3. WHEN PROJECT_ADMIN navigates THEN the system SHALL show user management and monitoring tools
4. WHEN USER navigates THEN the system SHALL show emergency, mapping, and personal features
5. WHEN user tries to access unauthorized navigation THEN the system SHALL hide or disable those options

### Requirement 7: Real-time Features by Role

**User Story:** As a PROJECT_ADMIN, I want real-time access to my users' devices and communications, so that I can provide effective monitoring and support.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN PROJECT_ADMIN initiates video call THEN the system SHALL connect to assigned user's device
2. WHEN USER triggers emergency THEN the system SHALL immediately notify their PROJECT_ADMIN
3. WHEN PROJECT_ADMIN monitors devices THEN the system SHALL show real-time status of assigned users
4. WHEN USER updates location THEN the system SHALL update PROJECT_ADMIN's monitoring dashboard
5. WHEN ROOT_ADMIN views metrics THEN the system SHALL show real-time system-wide statistics

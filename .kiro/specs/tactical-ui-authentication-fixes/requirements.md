# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification addresses critical user interface, authentication, and internationalization issues discovered during production testing of the TacticalOps platform. The system is currently running but has several functional defects that prevent proper user experience and access.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Tactical Theme Implementation

**User Story:** As a user accessing the TacticalOps platform, I want to see a consistent tactical camo theme throughout the entire application, so that the interface reflects the military/tactical nature of the system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user first loads the website THEN the loading/splash screen SHALL display tactical camo background (desert/forest pattern) instead of blue theme
2. WHEN the application is loading THEN the loading spinner and text SHALL use tactical amber/green colors (#D4AF37, #4A5D23) instead of blue
3. WHEN a user navigates through the application THEN all screens SHALL maintain consistent tactical theming
4. WHEN the application displays any loading states THEN they SHALL use the tactical color scheme

### Requirement 2: Authentication System Functionality

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want to log in using the correct credentials (admin/admin123), so that I can access the tactical dashboard and manage the system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user enters username "admin" and password "admin123" THEN the system SHALL authenticate successfully
2. WHEN authentication succeeds THEN the user SHALL be redirected to the appropriate dashboard based on their role
3. WHEN authentication fails THEN the system SHALL display a clear error message
4. WHEN the database connection is unavailable THEN the system SHALL handle the error gracefully
5. WHEN a user has ROOT_ADMIN role THEN they SHALL have access to all administrative functions

### Requirement 3: Multi-language Support (Arabic/English)

**User Story:** As a user, I want to switch between Arabic and English languages, so that I can use the application in my preferred language with proper RTL support.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks the Arabic language button THEN the interface SHALL switch to Arabic with RTL layout
2. WHEN a user clicks the English language button THEN the interface SHALL switch to English with LTR layout
3. WHEN the language is Arabic THEN all text elements SHALL be translated to Arabic
4. WHEN the language is Arabic THEN the layout SHALL properly support right-to-left reading direction
5. WHEN a user refreshes the page THEN the selected language SHALL persist

### Requirement 4: Database Connection and Data Management

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the application to properly connect to the Supabase database and manage user data, so that authentication and user management functions work correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN it SHALL successfully connect to the Supabase database
2. WHEN database connection fails THEN the system SHALL provide fallback functionality or clear error messages
3. WHEN admin users are created THEN they SHALL be stored in the database with correct role assignments
4. WHEN user authentication occurs THEN it SHALL query the database for valid credentials
5. WHEN the database schema is missing THEN the system SHALL handle the error gracefully

### Requirement 5: Comprehensive Testing Coverage

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive automated tests for all critical functionalities, so that issues are caught before deployment and user experience is validated.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running authentication tests THEN all login scenarios SHALL be validated (success, failure, different roles)
2. WHEN running UI tests THEN the tactical theme SHALL be verified on all pages and loading states
3. WHEN running internationalization tests THEN both Arabic and English translations SHALL be validated
4. WHEN running database tests THEN connection, user creation, and data retrieval SHALL be verified
5. WHEN running end-to-end tests THEN complete user workflows SHALL be validated from login to dashboard usage
6. WHEN tests are executed THEN they SHALL provide clear reports of any failures with screenshots
7. WHEN critical functionality fails THEN tests SHALL capture detailed error information for debugging

### Requirement 6: Error Handling and User Feedback

**User Story:** As a user, I want clear feedback when something goes wrong, so that I understand what happened and what I can do about it.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN authentication fails THEN the system SHALL display specific error messages (invalid credentials, server error, etc.)
2. WHEN the database is unavailable THEN the system SHALL show a maintenance message instead of crashing
3. WHEN language switching fails THEN the system SHALL maintain the current language and show an error
4. WHEN loading takes longer than expected THEN the system SHALL show progress indicators with tactical theming
5. WHEN any critical error occurs THEN the system SHALL log detailed information for debugging

### Requirement 7: Performance and Reliability

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to load quickly and work reliably, so that I can efficiently use the tactical operations platform.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user loads the homepage THEN it SHALL load within 3 seconds
2. WHEN a user authenticates THEN the login process SHALL complete within 2 seconds
3. WHEN switching languages THEN the change SHALL occur within 1 second
4. WHEN the application encounters errors THEN it SHALL recover gracefully without requiring a page refresh
5. WHEN multiple users access the system simultaneously THEN performance SHALL remain consistent

# React Native Hybrid Enhancement - Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification defines the implementation of a hybrid architecture that combines the existing Next.js PWA dashboard with a new React Native mobile application using Expo SDK 53 and React 19. The system will provide administrators with a powerful web-based control interface while offering users a native mobile app with enhanced device access, background processing, and real-time synchronization capabilities.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Hybrid Architecture Foundation

**User Story:** As a system architect, I want a hybrid architecture that leverages both PWA and React Native strengths, so that we can provide optimal experiences for both administrators and end users.

#### Acceptance Criteria

3. WHEN both platforms are running THEN they SHALL share the same Next.js backend APIs
4. WHEN data changes occur THEN both PWA and mobile app SHALL synchronize in real-time
5. WHEN users access features THEN the appropriate platform SHALL provide the optimal experience
6. WHEN the system scales THEN both platforms SHALL use the same PostgreSQL database

### Requirement 2: React Native Mobile App with Expo SDK 53

3. WHEN data needs syncing THEN the app SHALL use expo-task-manager for scheduled updates
4. WHEN push notifications arrive THEN the app SHALL handle them using expo-notifications
5. WHEN background limits are reached THEN the app SHALL gracefully manage task priorities
6. WHEN the app returns to foreground THEN it SHALL sync any missed data automatically

### Requirement 5: Security and Permission Management

**User Story:** As a security-conscious user, I want proper permission handling and secure data storage, so that my personal information is protected while enabling necessary monitoring features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN permissions are needed THEN the app SHALL use Expo's integrated permission system
2. WHEN sensitive data is stored THEN the app SHALL use expo-secure-store for encryption
3. WHEN background location is required THEN the app SHALL request proper iOS/Android permissions
4. WHEN camera access is needed THEN the app SHALL use expo-camera with permission prompts
5. WHEN audio recording occurs THEN the app SHALL use expo-audio with microphone permissions
6. WHEN file access is required THEN the app SHALL use expo-file-system with appropriate scopes

### Requirement 6: Real-time Communication and Streaming

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want real-time video/audio communication with monitored devices, so that I can provide immediate assistance and conduct remote monitoring.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN video calls are initiated THEN the system SHALL use LiveKit React Native SDK
2. WHEN audio streaming occurs THEN the app SHALL use expo-audio for high-quality recording/playback
3. WHEN real-time data sync is needed THEN the app SHALL use WebSocket connections
4. WHEN network conditions vary THEN the streaming SHALL adapt quality automatically
5. WHEN background sync is required THEN the app SHALL use expo-task-manager for data updates
6. WHEN push notifications are sent THEN they SHALL work reliably across both platforms

### Requirement 7: File System and Data Management

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want comprehensive file management capabilities, so that I can access, transfer, and manage files on monitored devices securely.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN file operations are needed THEN the app SHALL use expo-file-system for local access
2. WHEN files are uploaded THEN the app SHALL support blob uploads with file.blob() API
3. WHEN downloads occur THEN the app SHALL handle background downloading capabilities
4. WHEN file synchronization is required THEN the app SHALL sync with the backend APIs
5. WHEN storage limits are reached THEN the app SHALL manage cache and temporary files
6. WHEN file security is needed THEN the app SHALL encrypt sensitive files using expo-crypto

### Requirement 8: PWA Dashboard Enhancement

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want the existing PWA dashboard enhanced with real-time mobile app data, so that I can monitor and control all devices from a unified interface.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN mobile devices connect THEN the PWA SHALL display their real-time status
2. WHEN device data updates THEN the PWA SHALL reflect changes immediately via WebSockets

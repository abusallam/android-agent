# Production Deployment Readiness - Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification defines the requirements for making the TacticalOps Platform production-ready with comprehensive documentation, agentic AI integration, three-tier security model, and robust deployment capabilities. The platform must be ready for civilian (open source), government, and military deployment tiers.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Complete Documentation Overhaul

**User Story:** As a platform administrator, I want comprehensive, up-to-date documentation that reflects the true nature of TacticalOps as a tactical operations platform, so that users and developers can understand and deploy the system effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN documentation is accessed THEN it SHALL reflect TacticalOps as an original tactical operations platform
2. WHEN ATAK references are found THEN they SHALL be removed and replaced with TacticalOps-specific content
3. WHEN documentation is reviewed THEN it SHALL include three-tier access model (Civilian/Government/Military)
4. WHEN agentic AI capabilities are documented THEN they SHALL include complete API references and integration guides
5. WHEN deployment guides are accessed THEN they SHALL provide clear instructions for all three tiers

### Requirement 2: Agentic AI Integration Framework

**User Story:** As an AI agent, I want complete access to the TacticalOps platform through well-documented APIs and interfaces, so that I can monitor, manage, assist, and automate tactical operations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an AI agent connects THEN it SHALL have access to comprehensive system monitoring APIs
2. WHEN agents need to execute tasks THEN they SHALL be able to schedule and manage cron jobs and systemd timers
3. WHEN agents provide assistance THEN they SHALL have access to natural language processing interfaces
4. WHEN agents analyze data THEN they SHALL have access to all tactical, communication, and emergency data
5. WHEN agents need documentation THEN they SHALL have access to complete knowledge bases and prompts

### Requirement 3: Three-Tier Security Architecture

**User Story:** As a security administrator, I want differentiated security levels for civilian, government, and military deployments, so that each tier meets appropriate security standards and compliance requirements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN civilian tier is deployed THEN it SHALL use standard TLS encryption and basic authentication
2. WHEN government tier is deployed THEN it SHALL use enhanced security with multi-factor authentication and audit logging
3. WHEN military tier is deployed THEN it SHALL use military-grade encryption with PKI and classification management
4. WHEN security policies are applied THEN they SHALL be tier-appropriate and configurable
5. WHEN compliance is required THEN each tier SHALL meet relevant standards (GDPR, FedRAMP, DoD)

### Requirement 4: Production Deployment Infrastructure

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want robust deployment configurations and infrastructure as code, so that I can deploy TacticalOps reliably across different environments and tiers.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deploying civilian tier THEN it SHALL use Docker Compose with basic configuration
2. WHEN deploying government tier THEN it SHALL use enhanced Docker configurations with security hardening
3. WHEN deploying military tier THEN it SHALL support air-gapped and classified environments
4. WHEN infrastructure is provisioned THEN it SHALL be automated and repeatable
5. WHEN monitoring is required THEN it SHALL include comprehensive health checks and alerting

### Requirement 5: Task Scheduling and Automation

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want automated task scheduling using modern Linux tools, so that routine operations, backups, and maintenance can be performed without manual intervention.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tasks need scheduling THEN the system SHALL support both cron jobs and systemd timers
2. WHEN agents schedule tasks THEN they SHALL be able to create, modify, and monitor scheduled operations
3. WHEN automated workflows are needed THEN they SHALL support complex multi-step operations
4. WHEN task execution fails THEN it SHALL provide proper error handling and alerting
5. WHEN calendar integration is required THEN it SHALL support open-source calendar solutions

### Requirement 6: Testing and Quality Assurance

**User Story:** As a quality assurance engineer, I want comprehensive testing suites and validation tools, so that I can ensure the platform works correctly across all tiers and deployment scenarios.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code is deployed THEN it SHALL pass all unit, integration, and end-to-end tests
2. WHEN security is tested THEN it SHALL pass vulnerability scans and penetration tests
3. WHEN performance is evaluated THEN it SHALL meet specified benchmarks for each tier
4. WHEN deployments are tested THEN they SHALL work correctly in development, staging, and production
5. WHEN agentic features are tested THEN AI agents SHALL be able to perform all documented operations

### Requirement 7: Open Source and Commercial Licensing

**User Story:** As a legal administrator, I want clear licensing terms for each tier, so that civilian users can access open source features while commercial tiers have appropriate licensing protection.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN civilian tier is accessed THEN it SHALL be available under MIT open source license
2. WHEN government tier is purchased THEN it SHALL have appropriate commercial licensing terms
3. WHEN military tier is deployed THEN it SHALL have specialized licensing for classified environments
4. WHEN third-party components are used THEN they SHALL have compatible licenses
5. WHEN licensing is reviewed THEN it SHALL comply with all legal requirements

### Requirement 8: Performance and Scalability

**User Story:** As a platform operator, I want the system to perform well under load and scale appropriately for different deployment sizes, so that it can handle real-world tactical operations effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN system load increases THEN it SHALL maintain response times under 2 seconds for critical operations
2. WHEN concurrent users access the system THEN it SHALL support at least 1000 simultaneous connections
3. WHEN data volume grows THEN it SHALL scale horizontally with additional resources
4. WHEN network conditions are poor THEN it SHALL maintain functionality with graceful degradation
5. WHEN offline operation is required THEN it SHALL support disconnected operations with sync capabilities

### Requirement 2: Authentication & Security Testing

**User Story:** As a security officer, I want to validate that all authentication and authorization mechanisms are working correctly, so that unauthorized access is prevented and data is protected.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN default admin credentials are tested THEN the system SHALL authenticate successfully with admin/admin123
2. WHEN invalid credentials are used THEN the system SHALL reject authentication and return appropriate error messages
3. WHEN JWT tokens are generated THEN they SHALL contain proper claims and expiration times
4. WHEN API endpoints are accessed without authentication THEN protected routes SHALL return 401 Unauthorized
5. WHEN role-based access is tested THEN users SHALL only access resources appropriate to their role level
6. WHEN password security is tested THEN passwords SHALL be properly hashed using bcrypt
7. WHEN session management is tested THEN sessions SHALL expire appropriately and be properly invalidated
8. WHEN multi-tier security is tested THEN civilian, government, and military tiers SHALL enforce appropriate security levels

### Requirement 3: API Functionality Testing

**User Story:** As an AI agent developer, I want to verify that all API endpoints are functioning correctly, so that agents can properly interact with the system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN agentic system control API is tested THEN all system control operations SHALL execute successfully
2. WHEN agent authentication API is tested THEN agents SHALL be able to authenticate and receive valid tokens
3. WHEN task management API is tested THEN tasks SHALL be created, updated, and verified correctly
4. WHEN tactical operations API is tested THEN all mapping and geospatial operations SHALL function properly
5. WHEN emergency response API is tested THEN alerts SHALL be processed and routed correctly
6. WHEN real-time WebSocket connections are tested THEN live updates SHALL be transmitted properly
7. WHEN API rate limiting is tested THEN excessive requests SHALL be properly throttled
8. WHEN API error handling is tested THEN appropriate error responses SHALL be returned with proper status codes

### Requirement 4: User Interface & Experience Testing

**User Story:** As an end user, I want the web interface to be fully functional, responsive, and accessible across all devices and browsers, so that I can effectively use the platform.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the login page is accessed THEN it SHALL load properly with all form elements functional
2. WHEN authentication is successful THEN users SHALL be redirected to the appropriate dashboard based on their role
3. WHEN the tactical dashboard is accessed THEN all mapping components SHALL render correctly
4. WHEN responsive design is tested THEN the interface SHALL adapt properly to mobile, tablet, and desktop viewports
5. WHEN dark/light theme toggle is tested THEN themes SHALL switch properly without layout issues
6. WHEN interactive map features are tested THEN all mapping controls SHALL function correctly
7. WHEN real-time collaboration features are tested THEN live updates SHALL be visible to all connected users
8. WHEN accessibility features are tested THEN the interface SHALL meet WCAG guidelines
9. WHEN browser compatibility is tested THEN the platform SHALL work correctly in Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge

### Requirement 5: Performance & Load Testing

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to verify that the platform performs well under normal and peak load conditions, so that it remains responsive during critical operations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN page load performance is tested THEN initial page load SHALL complete within 3 seconds
2. WHEN API response times are measured THEN average response time SHALL be under 200ms
3. WHEN concurrent user load is tested THEN the system SHALL handle at least 100 simultaneous users
4. WHEN database performance is tested THEN query response times SHALL be optimized with proper indexing
5. WHEN memory usage is monitored THEN the application SHALL not exceed reasonable memory limits
6. WHEN WebSocket performance is tested THEN real-time updates SHALL have minimal latency
7. WHEN file upload performance is tested THEN large files SHALL upload efficiently without timeouts

### Requirement 6: Security Vulnerability Assessment

**User Story:** As a security analyst, I want to identify and validate that common security vulnerabilities are properly mitigated, so that the platform is secure against known attack vectors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN SQL injection testing is performed THEN all database queries SHALL be properly parameterized
2. WHEN XSS testing is performed THEN user input SHALL be properly sanitized and escaped
3. WHEN CSRF testing is performed THEN all state-changing operations SHALL be protected with CSRF tokens
4. WHEN authentication bypass testing is performed THEN no unauthorized access SHALL be possible
5. WHEN session security is tested THEN session tokens SHALL be properly secured and rotated
6. WHEN input validation is tested THEN all user inputs SHALL be validated and sanitized
7. WHEN security headers are tested THEN appropriate security headers SHALL be present in all responses
8. WHEN encryption testing is performed THEN sensitive data SHALL be properly encrypted in transit and at rest

### Requirement 7: Data Integrity & Backup Testing

**User Story:** As a data administrator, I want to verify that data is properly stored, backed up, and can be recovered, so that critical information is never lost.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN data is created through the interface THEN it SHALL be properly stored in the database
2. WHEN database transactions are tested THEN ACID properties SHALL be maintained
3. WHEN backup procedures are tested THEN complete system backups SHALL be created successfully

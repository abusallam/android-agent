5. IF audio connection fails THEN the system SHALL attempt automatic reconnection up to 3 times
6. WHEN audio session is active THEN the system SHALL display mute/unmute controls for both parties

### Requirement 3: Screen Sharing and Remote Viewing

**User Story:** As an admin, I want to view the device screen in real-time, so that I can monitor device usage and provide technical support.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN screen sharing is requested THEN the system SHALL capture device screen with user permission
2. WHEN screen content is shared THEN the system SHALL stream at minimum 15 FPS for smooth viewing
3. WHEN sensitive content is detected THEN the system SHALL provide privacy controls and blur options
4. WHEN screen orientation changes THEN the system SHALL automatically adjust display layout
5. IF screen capture fails THEN the system SHALL provide alternative monitoring methods
6. WHEN screen sharing is active THEN the system SHALL minimize performance impact on device

### Requirement 4: Emergency Communication System

**User Story:** As an admin, I want to instantly communicate with devices during emergencies, so that I can provide immediate assistance and guidance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN emergency alert is triggered THEN the system SHALL automatically establish audio/video connection
2. WHEN emergency communication starts THEN the system SHALL override device audio settings for maximum volume
3. WHEN emergency session is active THEN the system SHALL record all communication for documentation
4. WHEN multiple emergencies occur THEN the system SHALL prioritize connections based on severity
5. IF emergency connection fails THEN the system SHALL attempt alternative communication methods
6. WHEN emergency is resolved THEN the system SHALL save session data and generate incident report

### Requirement 5: Session Recording and Playback

**User Story:** As an admin, I want to record video and audio sessions, so that I can review incidents and maintain documentation for security purposes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN recording is initiated THEN the system SHALL capture both video and audio streams simultaneously
2. WHEN recording is active THEN the system SHALL display recording indicator to all participants
3. WHEN storage space is limited THEN the system SHALL automatically manage file retention policies
4. WHEN playback is requested THEN the system SHALL provide video player with standard controls
5. IF recording fails THEN the system SHALL notify admin and attempt to recover partial recordings
6. WHEN recordings are stored THEN the system SHALL encrypt files and maintain access logs

### Requirement 6: Multi-device Stream Management

**User Story:** As an admin, I want to manage multiple device streams simultaneously, so that I can monitor several devices efficiently from one interface.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN multiple streams are active THEN the system SHALL display grid layout with up to 9 concurrent streams
2. WHEN stream priority changes THEN the system SHALL allow admin to focus on specific device feeds
3. WHEN bandwidth is limited THEN the system SHALL intelligently reduce quality of background streams
4. WHEN new device connects THEN the system SHALL automatically add stream to available grid position
5. IF stream becomes unavailable THEN the system SHALL show connection status and retry options
6. WHEN streams are managed THEN the system SHALL provide individual controls for each device

### Requirement 7: Adaptive Quality and Performance

**User Story:** As an admin, I want the streaming quality to adapt to network conditions, so that I maintain stable connections even with varying bandwidth.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN network bandwidth decreases THEN the system SHALL automatically reduce video resolution and frame rate
2. WHEN connection is unstable THEN the system SHALL prioritize audio quality over video quality
3. WHEN multiple streams compete for bandwidth THEN the system SHALL implement fair bandwidth allocation
4. WHEN quality changes occur THEN the system SHALL notify admin of current stream parameters
5. IF connection drops below minimum threshold THEN the system SHALL pause video and maintain audio only
6. WHEN network improves THEN the system SHALL gradually restore optimal quality settings

### Requirement 8: Privacy and Security Controls

**User Story:** As an admin, I want comprehensive privacy controls for streaming features, so that I can ensure compliance with privacy regulations and user consent.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN streaming is initiated THEN the system SHALL require explicit user consent on the device
2. WHEN privacy mode is enabled THEN the system SHALL blur or block sensitive areas of video feeds
3. WHEN recording occurs THEN the system SHALL clearly indicate recording status to all participants
4. WHEN data is transmitted THEN the system SHALL use end-to-end encryption for all streams
5. IF privacy violation is detected THEN the system SHALL automatically terminate session and log incident
6. WHEN consent is withdrawn THEN the system SHALL immediately stop all streaming and delete temporary data

### Requirement 9: Integration with Existing Features

**User Story:** As an admin, I want streaming features to integrate seamlessly with existing monitoring capabilities, so that I have a unified control interface.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN location tracking is active THEN the system SHALL overlay GPS coordinates on video streams
2. WHEN emergency alert triggers THEN the system SHALL automatically initiate video/audio connection
3. WHEN device status changes THEN the system SHALL reflect updates in streaming interface

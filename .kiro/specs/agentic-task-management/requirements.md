# Agentic Task Management System - Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Agentic Task Management System is an advanced feature that transforms the Android Agent AI platform into an intelligent task completion enforcer. This system enables project administrators to assign tasks to users while leveraging AI agents to automatically monitor and verify task completion through device sensors, location data, and application usage patterns.

The system creates a three-tier hierarchy where ROOT_ADMIN manages resources and project administrators, PROJECT_ADMIN interacts with AI agents to assign and monitor tasks, and the AI agent autonomously verifies task completion by accessing user devices and sensors in real-time.

## Requirements

4. WHEN the AI agent detects anomalies or potential task violations THEN the system SHALL flag suspicious activities and alert the PROJECT_ADMIN
5. IF multiple verification methods are required THEN the AI agent SHALL ensure all criteria are satisfied before marking task completion

### Requirement 4: User Task Dashboard and Notifications

**User Story:** As a User, I want to view my assigned tasks and receive notifications about task requirements, so that I can understand what is expected and complete tasks efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user logs into their dashboard THEN the system SHALL display all assigned tasks with clear descriptions, deadlines, and completion requirements
2. WHEN a new task is assigned THEN the system SHALL send push notifications to the user's device with task details
3. WHEN a user is making progress on a task THEN the system SHALL provide real-time feedback on completion status and remaining requirements
4. WHEN a task is completed THEN the system SHALL notify the user and update their task history
5. IF a user fails to complete a task within the deadline THEN the system SHALL send reminder notifications and alert the PROJECT_ADMIN

### Requirement 5: Real-time Task Progress Monitoring

**User Story:** As a PROJECT_ADMIN, I want to monitor real-time progress of all assigned tasks, so that I can intervene when necessary and ensure project objectives are met.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN PROJECT_ADMIN views the task monitoring dashboard THEN the system SHALL display real-time status of all active tasks with progress indicators
2. WHEN the AI agent updates task progress THEN the system SHALL immediately reflect changes in the PROJECT_ADMIN dashboard
3. WHEN a task is at risk of not being completed THEN the system SHALL highlight the task and suggest intervention actions
4. WHEN PROJECT_ADMIN needs detailed task analytics THEN the system SHALL provide completion rates, average completion times, and user performance metrics
5. IF the AI agent detects task completion THEN the system SHALL update the dashboard within 30 seconds and log all verification data

### Requirement 6: Intelligent Task Verification System

**User Story:** As an AI Agent, I want to use multiple verification methods to ensure accurate task completion detection, so that I can minimize false positives and provide reliable task monitoring.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN verifying location-based tasks THEN the AI agent SHALL use GPS coordinates, geofencing, and location history to confirm user presence at required locations
2. WHEN verifying activity-based tasks THEN the AI agent SHALL analyze accelerometer, gyroscope, and magnetometer data to detect specific movements or activities
3. WHEN verifying application-based tasks THEN the AI agent SHALL monitor app launches, usage duration, and specific in-app actions
4. WHEN verifying time-based tasks THEN the AI agent SHALL track task duration, start/end times, and schedule adherence
5. IF verification methods conflict THEN the AI agent SHALL use weighted scoring to determine task completion confidence and flag uncertain cases

### Requirement 7: Task Template and Automation System

**User Story:** As a PROJECT_ADMIN, I want to create reusable task templates and automate recurring task assignments, so that I can efficiently manage repetitive workflows.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN PROJECT_ADMIN creates a task template THEN the system SHALL save all task parameters, verification methods, and assignment rules for reuse
2. WHEN PROJECT_ADMIN sets up recurring tasks THEN the system SHALL automatically assign tasks based on schedules, user availability, and completion history
3. WHEN the AI agent learns from task patterns THEN the system SHALL suggest optimizations to task parameters and verification methods

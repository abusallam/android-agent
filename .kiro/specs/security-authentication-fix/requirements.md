# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification addresses critical security vulnerabilities in the Android Agent project that were introduced during previous modifications. The primary issue is a completely broken authentication system where bcrypt-hashed passwords cannot be verified due to MD5-based login verification. Additionally, there are unused dependencies, hardcoded configurations, and incomplete session management implementations that need to be resolved.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Fix Critical Authentication Vulnerability

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want to be able to log into the web interface using my credentials, so that I can manage connected Android devices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an administrator enters valid credentials THEN the system SHALL authenticate using bcrypt password verification
2. WHEN an administrator enters invalid credentials THEN the system SHALL reject the login attempt
3. WHEN the system stores admin passwords THEN it SHALL use bcrypt hashing with configurable rounds
4. WHEN the system verifies passwords THEN it SHALL use bcrypt.compare() instead of MD5 hashing
5. WHEN the authentication system is updated THEN existing bcrypt-hashed passwords SHALL remain valid

### Requirement 2: Implement Proper Session Management

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want secure session management with proper token handling, so that my login sessions are secure and properly managed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user logs in successfully THEN the system SHALL create a secure session token
2. WHEN Redis is available THEN the system SHALL use Redis for session storage
3. WHEN Redis is unavailable THEN the system SHALL fall back to memory-based sessions
4. WHEN a session expires THEN the system SHALL require re-authentication
5. WHEN a user logs out THEN the system SHALL invalidate the session token
6. WHEN session secrets are configured THEN they SHALL be used from environment variables

### Requirement 3: Remove Unused Dependencies and Clean Configuration

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the project to have clean dependencies and configuration, so that the system is maintainable and secure.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Redis dependencies are present THEN they SHALL be properly implemented or removed
2. WHEN environment variables are defined THEN they SHALL be used by the application
3. WHEN Docker configuration exists THEN it SHALL work with the corrected authentication system
4. WHEN the system starts THEN it SHALL not have unused or dangling dependencies

### Requirement 4: Fix Hardcoded Network Configuration

**User Story:** As a user deploying the Android Agent, I want configurable network settings, so that the system works in different network environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Android client connects THEN it SHALL use configurable server addresses
2. WHEN building APKs THEN the system SHALL allow dynamic server configuration
3. WHEN the server starts THEN it SHALL bind to configurable ports
4. WHEN network settings change THEN they SHALL be easily updatable without code changes

### Requirement 5: Maintain Backward Compatibility

**User Story:** As an existing user, I want my current setup to continue working after the security fixes, so that I don't lose access to my monitored devices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system is updated THEN existing client connections SHALL continue to work
2. WHEN database schemas change THEN existing data SHALL be preserved
3. WHEN configuration formats change THEN migration paths SHALL be provided
4. WHEN the API changes THEN existing endpoints SHALL remain functional

### Requirement 6: Security Hardening

**User Story:** As a security-conscious administrator, I want the system to follow security best practices, so that my deployment is protected against common vulnerabilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN passwords are processed THEN they SHALL never be logged or exposed
2. WHEN sessions are created THEN they SHALL use cryptographically secure random tokens
3. WHEN cookies are set THEN they SHALL include appropriate security flags
4. WHEN authentication fails THEN the system SHALL implement rate limiting
5. WHEN the system handles user input THEN it SHALL validate and sanitize all inputs

### Requirement 7: Improved Error Handling and Logging

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want clear error messages and proper logging, so that I can troubleshoot issues effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN authentication fails THEN the system SHALL log the attempt with appropriate details
2. WHEN configuration errors occur THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages
3. WHEN the system starts THEN it SHALL validate all required configuration
4. WHEN errors occur THEN they SHALL be logged with sufficient context for debugging
5. WHEN the system runs THEN it SHALL provide health check endpoints

### Requirement 8: Configuration Validation and Documentation

**User Story:** As a deployer, I want clear configuration options and validation, so that I can set up the system correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system starts THEN it SHALL validate all environment variables
2. WHEN configuration is missing THEN the system SHALL provide helpful error messages
3. WHEN Docker is used THEN the configuration SHALL be properly documented
4. WHEN defaults are used THEN they SHALL be secure and documented
5. WHEN configuration changes THEN the system SHALL detect and apply them appropriately

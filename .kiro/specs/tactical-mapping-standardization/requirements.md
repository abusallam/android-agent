# Tactical Mapping System - Standardization Requirements

## Introduction

This specification addresses the critical standardization and cleanup work needed for the Tactical Mapping System. Based on our analysis, the current system has dependency conflicts, inconsistent theming, missing internationalization, and needs senior-level code organization. This spec will transform the codebase into a production-ready, maintainable system with proper standards.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Mapping Library Standardization

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a single, consistent mapping library across all platforms so that the codebase is maintainable and free of conflicts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reviewing dependencies THEN only Leaflet-based libraries should be present
2. WHEN using mapping features THEN they should work consistently across web and React Native
3. WHEN adding new mapping functionality THEN it should use the standardized Leaflet API
4. WHEN building the application THEN there should be no mapping library conflicts
5. IF MapBox or MapLibre dependencies exist THEN they should be completely removed
6. WHEN deploying THEN the bundle size should be optimized without redundant mapping libraries

### Requirement 2: Tactical Theming System

**User Story:** As a tactical operator, I want military-appropriate themes including camouflage patterns so that the interface suits different operational environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN selecting themes THEN four options should be available: Light, Dark, Desert Camo, Forest Camo
2. WHEN using Desert Camo theme THEN colors should reflect desert environments (sand, tan, brown tones)
3. WHEN using Forest Camo theme THEN colors should reflect forest environments (green, brown, olive tones)
4. WHEN switching themes THEN the change should apply immediately across all components
5. IF the user prefers system theme THEN it should automatically switch between light/dark based on device settings
6. WHEN viewing tactical elements THEN markers and overlays should adapt to the selected theme

### Requirement 3: Multi-language Internationalization

**User Story:** As an international operator, I want the application in Arabic and English with proper RTL support so that I can use it in my native language.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN selecting Arabic language THEN the interface should display in Arabic with RTL layout
2. WHEN selecting English language THEN the interface should display in English with LTR layout
3. WHEN switching languages THEN all text should translate immediately without app restart
4. WHEN viewing tactical terms THEN military terminology should be accurately translated
5. IF the device language is Arabic THEN the app should default to Arabic on first launch
6. WHEN entering text THEN input fields should support both Arabic and English text entry

### Requirement 4: Comprehensive Permissions System

**User Story:** As a user, I want clear permission requests with explanations so that I understand why each permission is needed for tactical operations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the app launches THEN it should request essential permissions with clear explanations
2. WHEN location permission is denied THEN the app should explain why it's critical for tactical mapping
3. WHEN camera permission is requested THEN it should explain the need for photo capture and QR scanning
4. WHEN microphone permission is requested THEN it should explain the need for voice communication
5. IF permissions are denied THEN the app should provide guidance on enabling them in settings
6. WHEN all permissions are granted THEN the app should function with full tactical capabilities

### Requirement 5: Senior-Level Code Organization

**User Story:** As a senior developer, I want a well-organized codebase with proper separation of concerns so that the system is maintainable and scalable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reviewing the file structure THEN it should follow senior-level organization patterns
2. WHEN adding new features THEN developers should easily understand where code belongs
3. WHEN reviewing components THEN they should have consistent structure and naming conventions
4. WHEN examining services THEN they should follow singleton patterns with proper interfaces
5. IF TypeScript is used THEN all code should have proper type definitions and strict mode
6. WHEN building THEN there should be no linting errors or code quality issues

### Requirement 6: Production-Ready Documentation

**User Story:** As a team member, I want comprehensive documentation so that I can understand and contribute to the system effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reviewing documentation THEN it should cover all major components and services
2. WHEN setting up the development environment THEN clear instructions should be provided
3. WHEN understanding the architecture THEN diagrams and explanations should be available
4. WHEN contributing code THEN coding standards and guidelines should be documented
5. IF new features are added THEN documentation should be updated accordingly
6. WHEN deploying THEN production deployment guides should be comprehensive

### Requirement 7: Dependency Cleanup and Optimization

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want a clean dependency tree without conflicts so that the application is stable and secure.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reviewing package.json THEN only necessary dependencies should be present
2. WHEN building the application THEN there should be no dependency conflicts or warnings
3. WHEN updating dependencies THEN security vulnerabilities should be addressed
4. WHEN analyzing bundle size THEN it should be optimized for production deployment
5. IF duplicate functionality exists THEN redundant dependencies should be removed
6. WHEN installing THEN the process should be fast and reliable

### Requirement 8: Future-Ready Architecture

**User Story:** As a technical lead, I want an extensible architecture that supports future enhancements like VPN and mesh networking so that we can add advanced features without major refactoring.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN planning VPN integration THEN the architecture should support software-based VPN clients
2. WHEN considering mesh networking THEN the system should be ready for software mesh implementations
3. WHEN adding new communication protocols THEN the service layer should be extensible
4. WHEN integrating LiveKit mesh features THEN the architecture should accommodate distributed communication
5. IF hardware-based solutions are needed THEN the software should provide proper interfaces
6. WHEN scaling THEN the architecture should support horizontal scaling and load balancing

This software is specifically designed for family safety monitoring of disabled 
family members. By using this software, you acknowledge that:

1. **Consent Required**: You must have explicit consent from the person being 
   monitored, or legal authority to monitor them (such as a parent monitoring 
   a minor child or a legal guardian monitoring a disabled family member).

2. **Lawful Use Only**: This software must be used in compliance with all 
   applicable local, state, and federal laws regarding privacy, surveillance, 
   and disability rights.

3. **Safety Purpose**: This software is intended for safety and care purposes 
   only, not for surveillance or control that would violate the dignity and 
   rights of disabled individuals.

4. **Data Protection**: Users are responsible for protecting the privacy and 
   security of all data collected through this software.

5. **No Warranty for Safety**: While this software is designed to help with 
   safety monitoring, it should not be relied upon as the sole means of 
   ensuring someone's safety. Always have backup safety measures in place.

The contributors to this project are committed to creating technology that 
empowers families while respecting the rights and dignity of all individuals, 
especially those with disabilities.
